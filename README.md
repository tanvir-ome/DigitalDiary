# DigitalDiary
A diary is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Create an online Digital Diary where user can create memories with date specified, can upload images to any specific memory, modify the existing memory and can delete any specific memory from his/her diary. Last Modification date is also recorded in the system. One unique feature of the system is a user can set the importance (high, moderate, less important) of any event. Each user can be identified by the system.
